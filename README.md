# Heart Disease Data Analysis Project

**1. Import the Libraries and Dataset:**

The project kicks off by importing essential Python libraries for data analysis, including Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset, which contains information related to heart disease, is loaded for exploration and analysis

**2. Display Top 5 Rows of the Dataset:**

An initial glimpse into the dataset is provided by showcasing the first five rows. This step offers an overview of the columns and their corresponding data, including factors such as age, sex, and various health metrics.

**3. Check the Last 5 Rows of the Dataset:**

Similarly, the last five rows of the dataset are examined to ensure completeness and observe any potential patterns or anomalies.

**4. Find the Shape of the Dataset:**

The dimensions of the dataset, indicating the number of rows and columns, are determined. This step sets the stage for understanding the scale of the dataset.

**5. Get Information About the Dataset:**

A detailed overview of the dataset is obtained, providing insights into the total number of rows, columns, and the data types of each column. This information aids in structuring subsequent analyses.

**6. Check Null Values in the Dataset:**

The presence of missing values is assessed to ensure data integrity. Fortunately, the dataset is found to be free of any null values.

**7. Check for Duplicate Data and Drop Them:**

Duplicate records, if any, are identified and subsequently removed. This step is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of the dataset.

**8. Get Overall Statistics About the Dataset:**

A comprehensive statistical summary of the dataset is generated, offering key metrics such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles. This statistical insight aids in understanding the central tendencies of the data.

**9. Draw Correlation Matrix:**
